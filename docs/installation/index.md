# Installation Overview

tuinix ships as an ISO image that includes the installer, system configuration,
and all packages needed for a complete offline installation.

## Supported Architectures

| Architecture | ISO | Target Devices |
|--------------|-----|----------------|
| x86_64 | `tuinix.VERSION.x86_64.iso` | Standard PCs, laptops, servers |
| aarch64 | `tuinix.VERSION.aarch64.iso` | ARM64 devices with UEFI boot |

## Installation Modes

### Offline Installation (Default)

The ISO includes the complete system closure - all packages required for
installation are pre-cached. No internet connection needed for standard
configurations.

!!! success "Fully Offline"
    The tuinix ISO can install a complete system without any network access.
    This is ideal for air-gapped environments or locations with poor connectivity.

### Online Installation

If your configuration adds packages beyond the standard set, an internet
connection may be required to fetch additional packages.

## Get the ISO

Download the latest ISO from the
[releases page]({{ iso.releases_url }}) ({{ iso.version }}),
or build it yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timlinux/tuinix.git
cd tuinix

./scripts/build-iso.sh

# Build for aarch64 (ARM64)

```
