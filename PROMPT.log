PROMPT LOG - nixmywindows Repository
================================================================================
Date: 2025-12-03
Session: Initial Repository Setup

Prompt:
I want to turn this into a Git repo.
I would like a .github folder with README.md and assets/ for documentation (and add further docs there in a well organised manner as needed)
Maintain a file in the root of this folder called PROMPT.log into which you should write a comprehensive log of every prompt I give you.
Add all the niceties of a very well organised github repo, with things like package builds, testing in CI, templates for issues and PRs, a CLA agreement, badges on the readme showing project health and any other additions that the very nicest of git repositories have.
When you are ready, make the initial commit in the local git repo and then push this to a new repo under timlinux/nixmywindows and make sire gh command line client is optimally set up to work in this repo.
Leave claude directives and configurations in this folder to make future sessions with Claude productive and consistent.

Action Taken:
- Initialized Git repository
- Created PROMPT.log file for tracking all prompts
- Planning to create comprehensive GitHub repository structure with:
  - .github folder with workflows, templates, and documentation
  - CI/CD pipelines for testing and builds
  - Issue and PR templates
  - CLA agreement
  - Professional README.md with badges
  - Standard repository files (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
  - Claude configuration files for future sessions
  - Initial commit and GitHub repository creation

Session: Quality Assurance Setup

Prompt:
I want to include PROMPT.log in my git repo
I would like to have precommit hooks that check that my work is beautiful, consistent and of a high quality. Given that my project is going to comprise mainly of the following file types, add precommit hooks to do qa on these files before they are committed, add gh CI to do these same checks when PRs are submitted and add badges on the readme to show the status of all of our QA checks. Here are the file types:

* nix files (use the official nixfmt formatter)
* bash scripts
* Markdown
* html, css
* python
* go

Additional Request:
I added an icon in .github/assets called LOGO.png. It needs to be cleaned up (background made transparent, converted to svg etc) and then used as the mascott for all visual elements of this project.

Also extract a colour palette from that logo and create a brand design document under .github/BRAND.md which provides details on colours (taken from the logo), fonts (nice african font would be great) and other design ethos guidelines that I can feed to a LLM when generating assets for this project.

Additional Requests During Session:
1. "All the .md files with the exception of REQUIREMENTS.md should be moved into the .github folder. There should be an indx to them all provided in the README.md"

2. "Add the logo into the readme and each markdown file, along with a nice welcome to the project"

3. "please update PROMPT.log to make sure that every prompt I gave you is represented there"

Action Taken:
- Updated .gitignore to properly include PROMPT.log in repository
- Set up comprehensive pre-commit hooks configuration (.pre-commit-config.yaml)
- Configured quality checks for all requested file types:
  - Nix: nixfmt-classic formatter and nixpkgs-fmt
  - Bash: shellcheck linting and beautysh formatting
  - Markdown: markdownlint with custom configuration
  - HTML/CSS: djLint and prettier formatting
  - Python: black, isort, flake8, mypy for comprehensive quality
  - Go: gofmt, go-imports, golangci-lint, go-vet
- Added security scanning with detect-secrets and Trivy
- Enhanced GitHub CI workflows with dedicated quality check jobs
- Updated README.md with comprehensive badge display showing all QA statuses
- Integrated project logo into README header
- Created development setup script (scripts/setup-dev.sh) for easy onboarding
- Added markdownlint configuration and secrets baseline

Brand Design and Documentation:
- Created comprehensive brand guidelines (.github/BRAND.md) with:
  - Color palette extracted from logo (Ubuntu Orange #E95420, Warm Brown, etc.)
  - Typography guidelines featuring Ubuntu and African-inspired fonts
  - Design philosophy emphasizing Ubuntu principles
  - Mascot character guidelines and usage instructions
  - Implementation notes for AI asset generation
- Added assets documentation with logo processing guidelines

Documentation Reorganization:
- Moved all .md files except REQUIREMENTS.md to .github folder
- Created comprehensive documentation index in README.md with categorized sections
- Updated all internal file references to maintain functionality
- Added Quality Assurance section to README explaining our QA system

Visual Identity Enhancement:
- Added welcoming logo headers to all documentation files
- Integrated Ubuntu philosophy messaging throughout ("I am because we are")
- Enhanced community appeal with warm, inviting language
- Consistent brand presentation across all project materials

Quality Assurance Infrastructure:
- Pre-commit hooks for local development
- GitHub Actions CI/CD for PR validation
- Comprehensive badge system showing project health
- Security scanning and secret detection
- Automated formatting and linting for all file types
- Professional project presentation with logo integration

On GitHub


I want to make my readme.md a bit more professional and appealing to the
community. It should have a nice header with the logo, a short description of
the project, badges showing project health (build status, code coverage,
license etc) and a nice welcome message that explains the ethos of the project
and why people should get involved. Make sure to include links to all relevant
documentation in the .github folder.

It should also have badges showing the status of all the QA checks we have set
up. The badges should also show things like the progams and projects we use to
do the qa (eg precommit, nixpkgs-fmt, shellcheck etc) and nix etc.

It should be inspired by projects like Awesome Readme to make it the very best
readme possible.

I want the contributors to be a table because I am hoping more will come!
Include their github avatars and links to their github pages.

Add an automated step (in a release workflow or a small script) to regenerate
the contributors table from GitHub's API so it stays in sync;

Open a pull request with this README change for you, or push it directly if you
prefer (tell me which repo/branch to target and I'll create the PR).


Preparing the flake

I want this project to have a flake.nix and a nix develop environment that is
automatically set up when I enter the project folder by way or direnv.

The flake should provide all the development tools needed to work on this repo.

The goal of this flake is to be able to use nixos anywhere to install a remote
(or local) nixos that is described by this repo.

We should also have a few other key components. Everything should be as modular
as possible. Split the configuation into separate nix moduls as needed using
the directory structure below as a guide:Guidelines

/
  modules
  hosts
  scripts
  profiles
  software
  users

This represents a heirarchy of configuration where:

Software is collated into profiles which are then applied to hosts via modules.

Each host will be able to have host specific configuration as needed.

Users can be defined glolbally and attached to hosts as needed.

The host folder will have one subfolder per host (eg my laptop, a remote server
etc).

In that subfolder we will separate concerns so that we have these principle
concepts:

  - hardware configuration
  - system configuration
  - services configuration
  - networking configuration
  - security configuration
  - users configuration
  - disks configuration

Disk configuration should be managed by disko.
