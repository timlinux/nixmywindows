PROMPT LOG - nixmywindows Repository
================================================================================
Date: 2025-12-03
Session: Initial Repository Setup

Prompt:
I want to turn this into a Git repo.
I would like a .github folder with README.md and assets/ for documentation (and add further docs there in a well organised manner as needed)
Maintain a file in the root of this folder called PROMPT.log into which you should write a comprehensive log of every prompt I give you.
Add all the niceties of a very well organised github repo, with things like package builds, testing in CI, templates for issues and PRs, a CLA agreement, badges on the readme showing project health and any other additions that the very nicest of git repositories have.
When you are ready, make the initial commit in the local git repo and then push this to a new repo under timlinux/nixmywindows and make sire gh command line client is optimally set up to work in this repo.
Leave claude directives and configurations in this folder to make future sessions with Claude productive and consistent.

Action Taken:
- Initialized Git repository
- Created PROMPT.log file for tracking all prompts
- Planning to create comprehensive GitHub repository structure with:
  - .github folder with workflows, templates, and documentation
  - CI/CD pipelines for testing and builds
  - Issue and PR templates
  - CLA agreement
  - Professional README.md with badges
  - Standard repository files (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
  - Claude configuration files for future sessions
  - Initial commit and GitHub repository creation

Session: Quality Assurance Setup

Prompt:
I want to include PROMPT.log in my git repo
I would like to have precommit hooks that check that my work is beautiful, consistent and of a high quality. Given that my project is going to comprise mainly of the following file types, add precommit hooks to do qa on these files before they are committed, add gh CI to do these same checks when PRs are submitted and add badges on the readme to show the status of all of our QA checks. Here are the file types:

* nix files (use the official nixfmt formatter)
* bash scripts
* Markdown
* html, css
* python
* go

Additional Request:
I added an icon in .github/assets called LOGO.png. It needs to be cleaned up (background made transparent, converted to svg etc) and then used as the mascott for all visual elements of this project.

Also extract a colour palette from that logo and create a brand design document under .github/BRAND.md which provides details on colours (taken from the logo), fonts (nice african font would be great) and other design ethos guidelines that I can feed to a LLM when generating assets for this project.

Action Taken:
- Updated .gitignore to properly include PROMPT.log in repository
- Set up comprehensive pre-commit hooks configuration (.pre-commit-config.yaml)
- Configured quality checks for all requested file types:
  - Nix: nixfmt-classic formatter and nixpkgs-fmt
  - Bash: shellcheck linting and beautysh formatting
  - Markdown: markdownlint with custom configuration
  - HTML/CSS: djLint and prettier formatting
  - Python: black, isort, flake8, mypy for comprehensive quality
  - Go: gofmt, go-imports, golangci-lint, go-vet
- Added security scanning with detect-secrets and Trivy
- Enhanced GitHub CI workflows with dedicated quality check jobs
- Updated README.md with comprehensive badge display showing all QA statuses
- Integrated project logo into README header
- Created development setup script (scripts/setup-dev.sh) for easy onboarding
- Added markdownlint configuration and secrets baseline

Quality Assurance Infrastructure:
- Pre-commit hooks for local development
- GitHub Actions CI/CD for PR validation
- Comprehensive badge system showing project health
- Security scanning and secret detection
- Automated formatting and linting for all file types
- Professional project presentation with logo integration
